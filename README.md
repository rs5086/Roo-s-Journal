# Roo-s-Journal

I was really excited to write about a project that I'm developing for Engineering Week at the New York Hall of Science.  But I still don't undestand how journaling on Github works.  It took me a long time to get to this page, and I'm not even sure if it's correct. And i forgot what I wanted to write about.

I am creating a game (trying to).  If I had more time to just focus on that challenge the game could feed into my professional work with social impact startups. This happens all the time! I don't know how to express ideas, and when I try to ask for help, I end up getting confused and unfocused and discouraged.

The idea is to create a game that helps young New Yorkers map out how to get around the city (specifically to cool cultural spaces around the boroughs such as museums, DIY venues, urban farms, co-ops, and local businesses).  The game helps them figure out how to get from point A to point B with limited time and budget, using different services like bus, subway, or ridesharing apps like Via, Lyft, Juno (but not Uber)
